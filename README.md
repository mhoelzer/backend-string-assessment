# Kenzie Academy: Strings Assignment

For this assessment, you'll be completing some string manipulation functions within the string1.py and string2.py files. Then once you're done, people can open this up and run it in Python and be like, "Wow! You sure did some stuff!"

There is some light dependency on knowing how [Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should be able to figure it out as you go. There are a lot of string stuff in here, so knowing strings things is beneficial.

[string1.py](./string1.py) -- Complete the string functions in string1.py based on your knowledge of Python strings, indexing, slicing, and methods. This is the easier stuff.

[string2.py](./string2.py) -- Additional string function completions. This is the less easier stuff.

## PR (Pull Request) Workflow for this Assignment

1. _Fork_ this repository into your own personal github account. --> COMPLETED
2. _Clone_ your own repo to your local development machine. --> COMPLETED
3. Create a separate branch named `dev`, and checkout the branch. --> COMPLETED
4. Commit your changes, then `git push` the branch back to your own github account. --> COMPLETED
5. From your own Github repo, create a pull request (PR) from your `dev` branch back to your own master. --> COMPLETED
6. Copy/Paste the **URL link to your PR** as your assignment submission. --> COMPLETED
7. Your grader will post code review comments inline with your code, in your github account. Be sure to respond to any comments and make requested changes. **RESUBMIT** a new link to your PR after making changes. This is the code review iteration cycle. --> COMPLETED

# Extra Points:

Feel free to edit the README.md (this very text itself) of this assignment and enhance it. The README is the front-most facing page of your work, so it should make a good impression. As assigments get more complex, you will be expected to create READMEs with sufficient detail to capture all aspects of how your code is intended to be used: Cloning, dependencies, gotchas, quick-starts, deployment notes, etc. Since this doesn't have a lot of extra information to things to add in, this is a test drive to see how things look and work in the README files since I haven't done much with them before :)
